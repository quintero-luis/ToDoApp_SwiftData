A minimalist task management iOS app built with SwiftUI and SwiftData.
It allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed. Each task includes a title and an optional description field.

This project demonstrates modern SwiftUI data handling using @Model, @Query, and @Bindable with SwiftData. The UI is designed with responsiveness and clean interaction in mind, using NavigationStack, contextual sheets, and form-based editing.
